  sentences:
  - "    It was an ordinary evening. I was sitting at my laptop, finishing up a report
    for Mr. Swanson. Everything was going as usual \u2014 just another day, another
    task, my normal, ordinary life. But then I smelled burning. Before I could even
    process what was happening, the screen went black, and smoke started pouring
    out of the casing..."
  - "    I grabbed the laptop, tried to do something, but it was too late. It burned
    out. All my files, projects, plans \u2014 everything was gone. I thought, \"So
    what? It's just a piece of tech. No big deal!\" If only I knew how wrong I was... "
  - "    Fido was always by my side. He\u2019d greet me at the door, wagging his
    tail like I was his whole world. After the laptop burned out, I thought, \"Well,
    the worst is behind me. I\u2019ll handle th\u0443 consequences, no big deal!\"
    But that day, I was too busy. I was stressed about work, angry at myself, at
    the world. I didn\u2019t even notice the door was left slightly open..."
  - "    When I realized Fido was gone, I rushed to look for him. I called his name,
    ran through the streets, asked the neighbors. But he was gone. I felt awful.
    He was the only one who was always happy to see me, no matter what. And I lost
    him. \"It can\u2019t get worse,\" I told myself. How wrong I was..."
  - "    Lily said I\u2019d changed. That I\u2019d become cold, distant. I didn\u2019t
    listen. I was too wrapped up in my problems: the burned laptop, the missing Fido,
    work. \"Sure, life has handed me a box of troubles, but I\u2019ll manage,\" I
    thought..."
  - "    But one day, I came home, and she was gone. On the table was a note: 'I
    can\u2019t do this anymore. I\u2019m sorry.' I called her, texted her, but she
    didn\u2019t respond. I stood in the empty apartment and realized I\u2019d lost
    her. And myself. Life had found another way to remind me that there\u2019s always
    a deeper, darker hole..."
  - "    Mrs. Esposito was always strict but fair. She warned me I was behind on
    rent. But I was sure I\u2019d sort it out. \"My problems aren\u2019t fatal,\"
    I thought. \"There are people worse off than me. The worst is behind me; it\u2019s
    only uphill from here.\" But when I saw the eviction notice, I realized I\u2019d
    lost everything..."
  - "    My home, my sanctuary. I stood on the street with a suitcase in my hand,
    staring at the closed door. Mrs. Esposito wouldn\u2019t listen to me anymore,
    wouldn\u2019t even answer my messages. Oh well. The bad times can\u2019t last
    forever, right?.. "
  - "    Mr. Swanson always said I was one of the best. After losing my home, I thought,
    \"What else could possibly happen? I\u2019ve already made lemonade out of all
    the lemons life gave me...\" "
  - "    But I started being late, missing deadlines, making mistakes. I tried to
    explain it was temporary, that I\u2019d fix everything. But he just shook his
    head: 'You\u2019re not the man you used to be.' He was right. I\u2019d lost more
    than just my job \u2014 I\u2019d lost something far more important..."
  - "    Football was always my passion. When I started my business selling footballs,
    I thought I\u2019d finally found my place in life. After getting fired, I told
    myself, \"Now I\u2019ll bounce back \u2014 I\u2019ve got a lifeline!\" But I
    was blind. I didn\u2019t see how everything was falling apart..."
  - "    Competitors, debts, management mistakes \u2014 it all piled up like a snowball.
    When I realized the business had failed, I felt the ground slip from under me.
    It was the end. The end of everything I\u2019d built. It\u2019s hard to imagine
    anything worse! I wouldn\u2019t have had the imagination for it!.."
  - '    But life found a way to hit even harder. Nurse Kaylee was kind, but her
    eyes said it all. ''We have bad news,'' she said. A diagnosis. A serious illness.
    I stood in front of the mirror and looked at myself...'
  - "    Who was this person? What had become of him? I didn\u2019t recognize myself
    anymore. And I realized: this wasn\u2019t just a disease of the body. It was
    a disease of the soul. \"It can\u2019t get worse,\" I told myself. But I knew
    that wasn\u2019t true..."
  - "    You thought you could just gather your memories and fix everything? You
    thought that by understanding where you went wrong, you\u2019d become stronger?
    How naive. These memories aren\u2019t the key to salvation. They\u2019re the
    prison you built for yourself."
  - "    And now you\u2019re locked here, with me. I am you \u2014 the you who thought
    everything depended on you, who thought nothing could go wrong. You thought you
    could control your life? You can\u2019t even control yourself."
  - "    You are me. And I am you. We are one. And you\u2019ll never escape yourself. "
  - "    You want to fight? Fine. Let\u2019s see who you really are. You or me. Your
    hope or my truth."
